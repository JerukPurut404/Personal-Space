# I'm done with the CTF

I recently took on an exciting challenge to complete a Capture The Flag (CTF) for WordPress, and I managed to find all three keys!

## First Key

The first key, with the value **073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9**, was found at the address `http://[IP ADDRESS OF MR.ROBOT]/key-1-of-3.txt`. It felt amazing to find this key and get one step closer to completing the challenge.

## Second Key

Next, I found the second key, with the value **822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959**, in the `home/robot` directory. It was a euphoric moment to find this key and realize that I was getting closer to the end goal.

## Third Key

The third key, with the value **04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4**, was located in the root directory. It was a challenging hunt, but it felt amazing when I also found this key and successfully completed the challenge.


Overall, it was a great experience to do this CTF for WordPress, and I'm happy to have found all three keys. It tested my skills and helped me expand my knowledge. I'm already looking forward to the next challenge!
